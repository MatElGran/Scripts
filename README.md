A central repository for all interesting scripts I find browsing on the Internet, and recipes for various tasks I may have to do, never remember how to, but don't use often enough to warrant developing a full-fledged script (in the spirit of [Do nothing scripting](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation), I may however automate these a little more)

DISCLAIMER: I will probably maintain these on a need-to basis, which is to say quite infrequently, so expect things to be sub-optimal, out-of-date and probably bug-ridden.
